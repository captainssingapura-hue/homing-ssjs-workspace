/**
 * Declarative specification for one workspace kind. Implementations are
 * <b>stateless singletons</b> (typically a {@code final class} with an
 * {@code INSTANCE} static field) — they declare what a workspace kind
 * looks like, with zero embedded behaviour.
 *
 * <p>A {@code WorkspaceSpec} carries everything {@link GenericWorkspaceChrome}
 * needs to mount the workspace's chrome via
 * {@code mountWorkspaceShell(branch, parent, specJson)}:</p>
 *
 * <ul>
 *   <li>Static identity — {@link #kind()}, {@link #title()}.</li>
 *   <li>Widget registry — {@link #widgetEntries()}.</li>
 *   <li>Ribbon / footer — {@link #ribbonItems()}, {@link #footerItems()}.</li>
 *   <li>Party declarations — {@link #parties()} ({@link PartyDecl} per
 *       Party to construct at boot).</li>
 *   <li>Action dispatch — {@link #actionDispatch()} (ribbon/footer
 *       {@code actionId} to a typed {@link ActionDispatch}).</li>
 *   <li>Widget params codec references — {@link #widgetCodecs()}
 *       ({@link WidgetCodecRef} per widget kind that needs a non-empty
 *       codec).</li>
 * </ul>
 *
 * <p>Doctrines applied:</p>
 *
 * <ul>
 *   <li><b>{@link Stateless}</b> — pure declarations, so any two instances
 *       of an implementation are interchangeable and the singleton is a
 *       convenience rather than a requirement. Deliberately not
 *       {@code StatelessFunctionalObject}: a spec transforms nothing, and
 *       unlike a function its <i>identity</i> is load-bearing — {@link #kind()}
 *       is a wire identifier and an IDB scoping key.</li>
 *   <li><b>Names Are Types</b> — every cross-language identifier
 *       (party name, actor path, action id, widget kind) is carried in
 *       a typed record, not a loose string at the boundary.</li>
 *   <li><b>Make It Impossible Not Forbidden</b> — workspace authors
 *       cannot hand-write chrome JS. The only way to express a workspace
 *       is to fill in this declarative surface; anything the surface
 *       doesn't support has to land as a substrate primitive first.</li>
 *   <li><b>A Good Design Doesn't Pick Up Its Substrate</b> — the spec
 *       doesn't mention the persistence layer, event log, checkpoint
 *       store, Web Lock, or any other RFC infrastructure; the substrate
 *       handles those uniformly for every spec.</li>
 * </ul>

     * particular shape:</p>

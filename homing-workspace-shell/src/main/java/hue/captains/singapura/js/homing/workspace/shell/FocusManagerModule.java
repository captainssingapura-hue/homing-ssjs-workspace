/**
 * RFC 0049 — {@code FocusManager}: a <b>per-tab</b> focus manager. One instance
 * is 1:1 with a tab and owns the tab's <b>immutable</b> (position-independent)
 * focus mechanics — everything that operates on the tab's own content element:
 * {@code inert} on that content, placing native focus into it, the
 * {@code setActive(bool)} lifecycle call, {@code reconcile()} drift-repair, and
 * the widget-<b>originated</b> events (give-up = un-consumed {@code Escape} /
 * {@code homing-focus} release, and {@code intendedFocusIn} = a request to become
 * active).
 *
 * <p>Because its listeners live on the tab's content element, the manager
 * <b>travels with the tab</b> (a DOM re-parent preserves listeners) and is
 * disposed with it. The <b>workspace</b> owns everything positional/mutable —
 * the single selection, exclusivity, visuals, clicks/arrows/Enter — and drives
 * {@code enter} / {@code release}; the manager enacts and reports, it never
 * decides selection. Supersedes RFC 0048's per-pane {@code FocusScope}.</p>
 *
 * <p>Activation focus is one function resolved by precedence (per-request &gt;
 * the tab's registered default &gt; system fallback: focus the content if it
 * isn't already in the tab). {@code setActive} is pure lifecycle — it never
 * focuses — so there is no {@code inert}-vs-{@code setActive} ordering.</p>
 *
 * <p>Dependency-free; builds no DOM and applies no styling of its own.</p>

// COPIED FROM homing-studio-base, and it was never the studio's. Nothing in
// the studio constructs a FocusManager; the workspace's focus coordinator is
// its only caller there, as here. It imports nothing, and its whole subject is
// one tab's content element - inert, blur, the drift watch - so it belongs
// beside the coordinator that drives it rather than in a UI layer neither of
// them is about.
//
// It is a VERBATIM copy on purpose. The deep/shallow model it serves is the
// pre-party one, and the MultiTabPane swap replaces it rather than ports it:
// keeping this identical to core's is what makes it delete cleanly then.
